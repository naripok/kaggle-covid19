# COVID Global Forecast: SIR Model Applied to Development Countries Data

In the context of the global COVID-19 pandemic, Kaggle has launched several challenges in order to provide useful insights that may answer some of the open scientific questions about the virus. This is the case of the [COVID19 Global Forecasting](https://www.kaggle.com/c/covid19-global-forecasting-week-1), in which participants are encouraged to fit worldwide data in order to predict the pandemic evolution, hopefully helping to determine factors that impact the transmission rate of COVID-19.
